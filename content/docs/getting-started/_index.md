# Getting Started

Hono works on multi-platforms. In this section, we introduce instructions for Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and Bun.

In all of them, TypeScript is out of the box, and development on a local environment is easy. And, we can release quickly with Cloudflare Workers. Deno also has the edge platform "*Deno Deploy*". Maybe Bun will have the edge runtime for publishing.

In this section, you can know the following about each of your platforms:

* Setup environments
* Installation
* "*Hello World*"
* How to run
* How to deploy
* Testing

Let's get started!
